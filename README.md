CS498 Lab
I did the first part of this lab in visual studio code, then step 2 basically said "The next step is to get our code into a github repo"
and then skipped the actual bit of how to do that to continue to say "Once the github repo is setup add the CI script and you're done".
So basically, I have no fucking idea how to actually get the original functioning program onto this.
